<h1> Once upon a time.. </h1>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;"> A young (even if not so young anymore) student was dissatisfied with the topics covered during classes at his university... He didn't want to learn to "discuss" about things. He wanted to learn how to do things. </p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;"> And so one day he discovered a brilliant website which no longer exists: pdf drive dot com. Wow. What an infinite lake of bibligoraphical resources and knowledge.
Should he start learning immediately??? That's a big decision, because he is never free. There is always some ridicolously useless task that his professors are assigning to him. If he wants to work during the night, he'll have to sacrifice his rest/social life/phone calls with his girlfriend. If he wants to work during the weekend, he'll have to sacrifice part of his GPA. He really doesn't know what to do.
</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;"> But then the realization comes. What if he could work every day, even if for a very short amount of time? Why not setting up a schedule allowing him to work on his passions 1.15 hour every day during working days and 2 hours during the weekend? It would still mean working on his passions for at least 10 hours a week. If you think about, it doesn't seem so bad. But his heart is full of doubts... Will it be enough? He doesn't wanna play. He wanna learn. In this ocean of doubts and doomers... </p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <em> ...only one thing is certain... </p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <strong> CONSISTENCY is the key </strong> </p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> Now <a href="../lounge.html"> go back on the lounge </a> page and continue with the plan idiot! </p>
