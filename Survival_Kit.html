            <p>
                In the following sections, a "personal survival kit" is not considered to be an additional/separated pack, but rather a list
                comprising all the most essential survival gear one should carry on a wilderness expeditions. <br>
                The alternatives are usually two: <strong>buy a prefabricated kit </strong>(you can find plenty on the internet) or <strong>make your own</strong>.
                The second option will most likely require more time, investigation, and background knowledge, but it's also usually
                preferred by experts. The reasons are many:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Purchasing survival items separately will allow you to <strong>familiarize with their characteristics and to test their reliability</strong>
                        independently from the rest of the gear. Unprepared amateurs typically purchase prefabricated kits and never really inspect them.
                        They trust the fact that carrying around such gear will be enough in case of emergency. You don't want to do that. Learn how to use
                        the tools you buy before going off-the-grid.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There's <strong>no 'one fits all' </strong>personal survival kit. The amount of weight you can bring with you is limited and varying circumstances
                        (e.g. climatic conditions, type of regions and activities, ) will require different tools.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Most of preassembled survival kits on the market tend to exploit the unexperienced eye of the average buyer and make
                        profits over <strong>cheap quality tools</strong> or useless additional gadgets.

                <h4>Belt Knife</h4>
                <p>
                    The first item in your personal survival kit should always be a belt knife. The knife represents a kit within your kit.
                    It has an incredibly large variety of uses (splitting wood, twisting and prying objects, shape components for traps and shelters, etc.)
                    <strong>Keep your knife sharp!</strong> You can carry around a sharpening stone too, or you might be able to find one. Any fairly smooth
                    stone will work.

            <p>
                What follows is a brief list of items that you should <strong>always include in your personal survival kit</strong>. They represent the pillars
                of your survival equipment. Try to find some smart ways to keep them well organized.

                <ul class="a">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Belt knife and optional sharpening stone:</strong> We already talked about it. Bring also a replacement to be extra safe.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bandana: </strong>Keeps your head safe from the sun and can be used as an emergency bandage or cool compress. The more colorful
                        the bandana, the better. We want to be seen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong> Lighter, matches and candles: </strong> You'll need to be able to start a fire. Now, the most reasonable thing to do is
                        probably to pack both some lighters and matches, since both items have different pros and cons. For instance, matches will work
                        also in freezing environments while lighters are more reliable in case of rain and can be used one-handedly. The candle will
                        instead help you get the fire going. In any case, try to find some small waterproof recipients to keep all these tools as dry
                        as possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Duct tape:</strong> Duct tape can be useful for a multitude of necessities. One can use it while building a shelter,
                        to repair just about any type of equipment, or to keep a fire alive (since it tends to burn slowly). Tape can obviously prove
                        effective in fixing bandages to heal wounds. Let's point it out again: the more colorful, the better. Colored duct tapes exist.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>A metal cup:</strong> Useful for drinking and boiling water!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Dried food:</strong> Having food at your disposal will improve your physical and psychological performance.
                        There are plenty of options, look online for the one that fits your necessities. Remember, you are looking for fat and protein.
                    </li>
                </ul>
