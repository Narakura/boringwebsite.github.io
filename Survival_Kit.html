            <p>
                In the following sections, a "personal survival kit" is not considered to be an additional/separated pack, but rather a list
                comprising all the most essential survival gear one should carry on a wilderness expeditions. <br>
                The alternatives are usually two: <strong>buy a prefabricated kit </strong>(you can find plenty on the internet) or <strong>make your own</strong>.
                The second option will most likely require more time, investigation, and background knowledge, but it's also usually
                preferred by experts. The reasons are many:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Purchasing survival items separately will allow you to <strong>familiarize with their characteristics and to test their reliability</strong>
                        independently from the rest of the gear. Unprepared amateurs typically purchase prefabricated kits and never really inspect them.
                        They trust the fact that carrying around such gear will be enough in case of emergency. You don't want to do that. Learn how to use
                        the tools you buy before going off-the-grid.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There's <strong>no 'one fits all' </strong>personal survival kit. The amount of weight you can bring with you is limited and varying circumstances
                        (e.g. climatic conditions, type of regions and activities, ) will require different tools.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Most of preassembled survival kits on the market tend to exploit the unexperienced eye of the average buyer and make
                        profits over <strong>cheap quality tools</strong> or useless additional gadgets.

                <h4>Belt Knife</h4>
                <p>
                    The first item in your personal survival kit should always be a belt knife. The knife represents a kit within your kit.
                    It has an incredibly large variety of uses (splitting wood, twisting and prying objects, shape components for traps and shelters, etc.)
                    <strong>Keep your knife sharp!</strong> You can carry around a sharpening stone too, or you might be able to find one. Any fairly smooth
                    stone will work.

            <p>
                What follows is a brief list of items that you should <strong>always include in your personal survival kit</strong>. They represent the pillars
                of your survival equipment. Try to find some smart ways to keep them well organized.

                <ul class="a">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Belt knife and optional sharpening stone:</strong> We already talked about it. Bring also a replacement to be extra safe.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bandana: </strong>Keeps your head safe from the sun and can be used as an emergency bandage or cool compress. The more colorful
                        the bandana, the better. We want to be seen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong> Lighter, matches and candles: </strong> You'll need to be able to start a fire. Now, the
                        most reasonable thing to do is to pack both some lighters and matches, since both items have
                        different pros and cons. For instance, matches will work also in freezing environments while
                        lighters are more reliable in case of rain and can be used one-handedly. Experts suggest butane
                        lighters, especially in case of challenging weathers.  A candle will instead help you get the fire
                        going. If you want to be a real pro, carry a magnesium flint striker to use a signaling device.
                        In any case, try to find some small waterproof recipients – possibly made of metal - to keep all
                        these tools as dry as possible. And remember: make sure you’ve practiced enough with these items
                        before starting your expeditions.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Fire­starting tinder: </strong>You’ll be able to find many alternatives on the market (pastes,
                        pellets, etc.). You can gather more tinder as you proceed with your off-grid journey, such as small
                        pieces of bark or dried grass.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Duct tape:</strong> Duct tape can be useful for a multitude of necessities. One can use it while building a shelter,
                        to repair just about any type of equipment, or to keep a fire alive (since it tends to burn slowly). Tape can obviously prove
                        effective in fixing bandages to heal wounds. Let's point it out again: the more colorful, the better. Colored duct tapes exist.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>A metal cup:</strong> Useful for drinking and boiling water!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Dried food:</strong> Having food at your disposal will improve your physical and psychological performance.
                        There are plenty of options, look online for the one that fits your necessities. Remember, you are looking for fat and protein.

                    <h4>Carrying Case</h4>
                    <p>
                        The container you choose for carrying your kit must be metallic, capacious and at the same time <strong>easy to carry</strong>. It should 
                        be protective, sealable and waterproof. The ideal case should both allow you to <strong>bring and boil water</strong>.

                    Assuming that all the previously listed items are going to fit pretty comfortably into your pockets, it’s now time to
                    search for some solid container to gather some more advanced survival gear. The challenge here is to find the <strong>
                    right balance</strong> between the weight/transportability of your kit and its exhaustiveness. Keep in mind that the following checklist
                    should be retailored to match the conditions of your journey.
