<h3> Green Tea Cooler </h3>
<p> Chock full of vitamins and minerals,
this elixir is real shit. Makes your butt round and shiny.
Careful, too much health is harmful. </p>

<h3> Raspberry Ice Concentration </h3>

<p> Imagine a dog that pisses on some snow
on the side of the most crowded street. Imagine
people step on it with their dirty boots. 
Mix that with some incredibly toxic blue 
detergent and there you go! </p>

<h3> Blueberry Bliss Elixir </h3>
<p> Careful dude, this is heavy stuff. 
I knew a guy that knew a guy that killed his 
grandma's cat after drinking this.. 
The justification he gave in court? 
He said the cat was verbally harassing him.. 
Dunno.
