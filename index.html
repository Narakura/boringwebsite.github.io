            <p>
                Going to the beach is always fun, isn’t it? And yet such pleasurable environment can easily put your life at risk.
                I bet you are thinking about shark attacks, or poisonous jellyfish. Truth is, you shouldn’t be worried about
                any of these really. Sure, a shark can be pretty deadly, but what’s the likelihood of encountering one? Instead, a jellyfish
                is more common but hardly lethal. Let’s try to be more rational.
                What about skin cancer? How many times did you get sunburnt while enjoying a swim or a napping on the sand? Melanomas
                are significantly more probable and fatal than you think. And yet, <em>
                    most people wouldn’t even consider them as incumbent
                    “dangers”.
                </em>
                The interesting question here is: Why? Our cognitive processes are influenced by two forces:
                <strong> rationality </strong> (logic, pragmatism) and <strong> instinct </strong> (intuitions,
                fear and other emotions dictated by past experiences). Every time we evaluate risk, rational thoughts
                will be filtered by unconscious impulses. Before taking any decision, the critical assessment of your
                risk perception should always take in consideration the <em>"Terror"</em> (or the <em>“Optimism”</em>), as
                measurements of the impact that instincts and emotions will have on your analysis. Pay attention to this,
                or you'll end up dying of skin cancer while looking out for sharks.

                        <strong>Training and Knowledge</strong><br />Experience shapes our brain’s functions and structure throughout our life.
                        Survival knowledge, continuous training, and pragmatic simulations will help us “re-program” our behaviors to ensure a more
                        effective reaction to stress. Regular practice of survival skills is what makes our instincts more helpful than harmful during a
                        crisis.

                        <strong>Physical Fitness</strong><br />If you are obese your survival likelihood drops in almost any disastrous condition.
                        Overweight people are slower and more frequently subject to heart-attack. Healthy habits (proper exercise and diet,
                        abstinence from tobacco, alcohol, and drugs) can prove paramount for your endurance.

                        <strong>Resilience and Psychological Attitude</strong><br />
                        Resilience is about controlling our psychological responses to evolving surrounding conditions.
                        Fostering resilience finds roots in the development of: (i) the belief of being able to influence events,
                        (ii) the inclination to seek for meaning in uncertain circumstances, (iii) the willingness to learn from our experiences.
                        Never underestimate the relevance of an adequate psychological attitude in tackling extreme pressure. Finding a significant
                        purpose in misadventures can undoubtedly save your life!

                        Whether you make it yourself or purchase it, the way you set up your kit is limited only by your imagination.

                        <strong>Leadership and Team Work</strong><br />
                        Being in a group has advantages and disadvantages. Combined skills, knowledge and resources are balanced by
                        potential conflicts and shared vulnerabilities. Assess weak-points (old age, injuries, antisocial behaviors)
                        as well as resourceful members of your team (owners of food and water supplies, medicines, competences, etc.).

                    Panicking paralyzes you and prevents decisive actions. It’s like in the movies. The guy that freaks out is the first who dies.
                    You don’t want to be that character. It appears to be true: some people are naturally gifted when it comes to handling emergencies.
                    That said, practice makes perfect.<strong><br />The goal is to be trained enough to consciously and deliberately choose 
                    our response to disasters.</strong><br />Keep in mind the following points:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In case of panic attack, slowly and gently breath in from your nose and out from your mouth. Focus on the surrounding environment.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Plan for the worst. Literally. This is more than just being psychologically ready; it’s about being pragmatically prepared.
                            It's much easier to adjust to pleasant surprises than to unpleasant ones.
                            Roleplay simulations will play a central role here, especially if performed in the “learn from the mistakes of others” mindset.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fear has the unfortunate trait of being highly contagious. If you are part of a group and someone is panicking during an emergency,
                            take control over the group. Distract them from the terror. Bring their focus back on the few actions that can save their lives.

                    Ok, now you’ve managed to calm down. You are luckily still breathing, conscious about your surroundings.
                    <strong>What do you do now?</strong>Yes, you need a shelter. Yes, you’ll soon need water and food, and for
                    that you’ll need a fire. And what about a rescue signal? In reality, the prioritization of such necessities
                    varies drastically depending on the <em>environmental conditions </em>around you. Are you in the middle of
                    the desert or on top of a glacier?<br>
                    Having said that, experts usually recommend proceeding in the following order:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Handle incumbent necessities.</strong> If there are any urgent safety and/or health concerns
                            you should deal with them immediately. Temperature and injuries tend to be the most common.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Signal for rescue.</strong> Ok, now that you’ve taken care of immediate exigencies, let’s try to maximize
                            your chances of getting back home as soon as possible. The alternatives are many: blow a whistle, build a symbol
                            to communicate with aerial support, use fire and smoke,  move a mirror or reflecting surface to reflect sunlight, etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong> Focus on long-term survival. </strong>You’ll find useful advice in the next sections of this website.
                            And don’t forget, always try to be realistic about your chances of rescue. Accept the fact that you’ll probably be
                            on your own for a long time.

                    dissociation will probably arise. You will have lived a <strong>traumatic experience</strong> likely to negatively affect
